        I studied some research and tried to see if these theories and methods working on me,
        so I decide to integrate some solution about procrastination,
        and adding more features to origin thought.

        Procrastination, or you can just call it "Lazy", I didn't know this term until recent years,

        This is both easiest and hardest problem to me, clearly know how to fix that but just can't, kind of like mental illness
        But no matter what, I have to fight it no matter how many times I fail.
